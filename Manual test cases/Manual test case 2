Scenario 2: Application Form Validation Issues

Test Case ID: MA_TC_02

Title: Required Fields Validation on Job Application Form

Description: Verify that all mandatory fields (e.g., Name, Email, Resume/CV upload, etc.) on the job application form are validated such that they cannot be left empty without prompting an error.

Precondition: The job application form (accessible via “Apply” on the Join the Team page or specific job page) is displayed, and all required fields are marked (often with an asterisk *).

Steps:
	1.	Navigate to the job application form on the Adserve site (for example, click “Apply Here” for a specific job opening).
	2.	Leave all required fields blank (do not fill in Name, Email, and do not upload a resume, etc.).
	3.	Attempt to submit the form by clicking the Submit button.
	4.	Observe the form’s response and any validation messages that appear.

Expected Result: The form is not submitted. For each required field left blank, a clear error message is displayed (e.g., “Name is required”, “Email is required”, “Please upload your resume/CV”). The messages should appear immediately after clicking submit, indicating which fields need input.

Actual Result: N/A – (To be filled after execution)

Status: Not Executed (Pass/Fail after test execution)

ENV: Chrome /MacOS
