Scenario 2: Application Form Validation Issues

Test Case ID: MA_TC_03

Title: Resume Upload – Invalid File Format Rejection

Description: Check that uploading a resume in an unsupported file format triggers an appropriate error and does not allow form submission. (The form should accept only specified formats, e.g., PDF or DOC/DOCX files.)

Precondition: The application form is open and ready for file upload. Accepted resume file formats are known (e.g., as stated on the form, only PDF or Word documents are allowed).

Steps:
	1.	On the job application form, locate the Upload Your CV field.
	2.	Attempt to attach a file with an invalid format (for example, a .png image file or a .txt file) instead of a PDF or Word document.
	3.	After selecting the invalid file, try to submit the form.
	4.	Observe any error message or validation response related to the file upload field.

Expected Result: The system rejects the invalid resume file. An error message is shown, such as “Unsupported file format. Please upload a PDF or Word document.” The form is not submitted while the resume file is in a wrong format, and the user is prompted to upload an allowed file type.

Actual Result: N/A – (To be filled after execution)

Status: Not Executed (Pass/Fail after test execution)

ENV: Chrome /MacOS
