Scenario 2: Application Form Validation Issues

Test Case ID: MA_TC_04

Title: Mandatory Field Blank – Error Message Display

Description: Ensure that when a single required field (e.g., Email) is left blank, an appropriate validation message appears for that specific field upon submission attempt.

Precondition: The application form is loaded with all fields visible; at least one required field is intentionally left empty while others are filled correctly.

Steps:
	1.	Fill out the job application form, except leave one required field blank (for example, leave the Email field empty while filling all other required fields).
	2.	Click the Submit button to attempt form submission.
	3.	Check the page for an error message related to the blank Email field.

Expected Result: A clearly visible error message (for example, “Email is required”) is displayed near the Email field (or in a general error summary indicating Email is missing). The message accurately identifies the blank field. The form is not accepted/submitted due to this validation error.

Actual Result: N/A – (To be filled after execution)

Status: Not Executed (Pass/Fail after test execution)

ENV: Chrome /MacOS
