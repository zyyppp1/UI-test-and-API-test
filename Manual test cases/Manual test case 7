Scenario 3: Navigation & Link Functionality

Test Case ID: MA_TC_07

Title: External Links Verification

Description: Verify that all external links on the Adserve website function correctly. This includes checking that they open in a new browser tab (when appropriate) so the user doesn’t lose the Adserve site, and confirming that the external content is relevant and up to date (no incorrect or outdated pages).

Precondition: Adserve site pages containing external links (e.g., Contact Us page with social media/support links) are accessible. The tester can open new browser tabs/windows from the test environment.

Steps:
	1.	On the Adserve website, find all external links – these are links that lead to websites outside of adserve.com. For example:
	•	The contact email link (mailto) or any “Contact” hyperlink that opens an email client (if present).
	•	Social media links such as Twitter (twitter.com/adserveplc) and LinkedIn (linkedin.com/company/adserveplc).
	•	Any other third-party links or references on the site.
	2.	For each external link identified, click the link and observe the behavior:
	•	New Tab/Window: Confirm that the link opens in a new browser tab or window. 
	•	Correct Page Load: Verify that the external page loads successfully. 
	3.	Check the content of each external page for relevance and currency:
	•	Verify the page is indeed related to Adserve 
	•	Ensure there are no obvious issues on the external page 
	4.	Close the external pages and return focus to the Adserve site.

Expected Result:
	•	Each external hyperlink opens in a separate tab or window, preserving the Adserve website in the original tab.
	•	The external pages load without errors and display the expected content. 
	•	All external content is relevant and up-to-date: The links lead to the correct official pages.

Actual Result: N/A – (To be filled after execution)

Status: Not Executed (Pass/Fail after test execution)
